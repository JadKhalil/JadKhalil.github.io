        <p class="paragraph">
            Im a Palestinian second Year Software Engineer who worships Isaac Newton, as he is the god who created the modern world.
                    Many of my friends critize that Isaac Newton died a virign, however that is a simplistic critcism when considering his contributions
                    to modern calculas, physics and astronomy. Unfortunatly the individuals who critize him with such arguments have brains comparable to salmon and are unable to
                    comprehend the magnitude of his acheivments. <br><br>
                     I have minor anti-capitalist setements, as I beilive capatilism was built on an unsustainable 
                    model of growth, and profit. I am not saying to abandon capitalism, but a modification of the system is required. There is a common
                    misconception that capitalism drives inovation, however this is completly false, capitalism, as im sure you know is driven by profit. 
                    This never ending drive for profit hinderes inovation, and the development of the world as a whole.
                    capitalism only monetizes ideas that are profitable and those which do not hurt current vested interests. Ideas or innovation
                    that could threaten the market share of currently exsting profitable corporations are prevented. <br><br>
        
                    Renewable energies, space exploration, agriculture are all fields that have been hindered by the never ending search
                    for profit. We are now at a crossroad in our existince, to avoid catostrophic climate events we must divert or resources
                    from feuling endless entertanment and cusumption, to a humble existince where scientific inovation is valued over all.

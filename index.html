            Im a Palestinian second Year Software Engineer who worships Isaac Newton, as he is the god who created the modern world.vMany of my 
          friends criticize that Isaac Newton died a virgin, however that is a simplistic criticism when considering his contributions to modern calculus, 
          physics and astronomy. Unfortunately the individuals who criticize him with such arguments have brains comparable to a goldfish and are 
          unable to comprehend the magnitude of his achievements. <br><br>
          
           I have minor anti-capitalist sentiments, as I believe capitalism was built on an unsustainable model of growth, and profit. 
          I am not saying to abandon capitalism, but a modification of the system is required. There is a common misconception that capitalism 
          drives innovation, however this is completely false, capitalism, as i'm sure you know is driven by profit. This never ending drive for 
          profit hinders innovation, and the development of the world as a whole.  capitalism only monetizes ideas that are profitable and those 
          which do not hurt current vested interests. Ideas or innovation that could threaten the market share of currently existing profitable 
          corporations are prevented. <br><br>
          
          
         Renewable energies, space exploration, agriculture are all fields that have been hindered by the never ending search for profit. 
          We are now at a crossroad in our existence, to avoid catastrophic climate events we must divert our resources from feuling endless 
          entertainment and consumption, to a humble existence where scientific innovation is valued over all.
